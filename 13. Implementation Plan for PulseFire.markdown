# Implementation Plan for *PulseFire*

## Introduction
This Implementation Plan outlines the steps to develop *PulseFire*, a first-person shooter (FPS) prototype using Unreal Engine, focused on delivering a multiplayer experience with responsive controller-based gameplay. The plan is structured to ensure the project meets its objectives within a $1,000 budget and a 2-3 week timeline, providing a clear roadmap for developers covering setup, development phases, testing, and delivery, while addressing budget constraints and quality standards.

## Context and Purpose
*PulseFire* aims to blend tactical gameplay inspired by *Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Vegas* with the fast-paced action of *Call of Duty*, targeting gamers aged 18-34 who prefer controller input and investors evaluating its funding potential. The prototype’s success hinges on delivering a polished, functional multiplayer experience that demonstrates the game’s core mechanics and potential for expansion.

## Methodology
The plan adopts an agile approach with iterative development and regular testing to ensure quality and alignment with requirements. It is divided into phases, each with specific tasks, deliverables, and estimated timeframes, leveraging Unreal Engine’s capabilities and reusing assets where possible.

  - Initial commit to Git repository.
- **Estimated Time**: 2 days

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics Development (Days 3-7)
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement player movement (walk, jump, crouch) using Blueprints.
  - Develop shooting mechanics (raycast-based) with C++ for performance.
  - Integrate controller input mappings for movement and actions.
  - Create basic health system and respawn logic.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Playable character with movement and shooting capabilities.
  - Functional health and respawn systems.
- **Estimated Time**: 5 days

### Phase 3: Multiplayer Integration (Days 8-12)
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up listen server for multiplayer sessions.
  - Implement session management (host/join via IP).
  - Replicate player actions (movement, shooting) across clients.
  - Handle player connections and disconnections.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional multiplayer setup for 2-4 players.
  - Synchronized gameplay across clients.
- **Estimated Time**: 5 days

### Phase 4: UI and Match Structure (Days 13-15)
- **Tasks**:
  - Design and implement main menu, multiplayer menu, and pause menu using UMG.
  - Create in-game HUD for health, ammo, and timer.
  - Develop match logic (timer, scoring, results screen).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Navigable menus and functional HUD.
  - Timed matches with scoring and results display.
- **Estimated Time**: 3 days

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Days 16-18)
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct internal testing for bugs and performance issues.
  - Perform playtests with 2-4 players to gather feedback.
  - Refine controller sensitivity and gameplay balance based on feedback.
  - Optimize performance to ensure 60 FPS and low latency.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Bug-free, optimized prototype.
  - Documented playtest feedback and refinements.
- **Estimated Time**: 3 days

### Phase 6: Finalization and Delivery (Days 19-21)
- **Tasks**:
  - Package the game as a Windows executable.
  - Prepare documentation for setup and playtesting.
  - Share the build with the client and playtesters via secure file-sharing.
  - Create a demo video or presentation for investors.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Final prototype build.
  - Setup instructions and documentation.
  - Investor presentation materials.
- **Estimated Time**: 3 days

## Timeline Overview
| **Phase**                     | **Days**   | **Key Deliverables**                            |
|-------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Project Setup                 | 1-2        | Unreal project, Git setup, initial assets       |
| Core Mechanics Development    | 3-7        | Movement, shooting, health, respawn             |
| Multiplayer Integration       | 8-12       | LAN multiplayer, session management             |
| UI and Match Structure        | 13-15      | Menus, HUD, match logic                         |
| Testing and Refinement        | 16-18      | Bug fixes, performance optimization, feedback   |
| Finalization and Delivery     | 19-21      | Packaged build, documentation, investor materials |

## Budget Allocation
The $1,000 budget is allocated as follows:
- **Development Tools**: $0 (Unreal Engine is free for development).
- **Assets**: $200 (for any necessary marketplace assets or tools).
- **Testing Hardware**: $300 (for mid-range PC or controller purchases, if needed).
- **Miscellaneous**: $500 (for unforeseen expenses or additional assets).

## Risk Management
- **Risk**: Delays in multiplayer integration due to networking complexities.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate extra time for testing and use Unreal’s documentation.
- **Risk**: Performance issues on target hardware.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize early and test on mid-range PCs throughout development.
- **Risk**: Scope creep from additional feature requests.
  - **Mitigation**: Adhere strictly to defined requirements, deferring non-essential features.

## Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual mechanics (e.g., shooting, movement) in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure systems work together (e.g., multiplayer with UI).
- **Playtesting**: Conduct sessions with external players to validate gameplay and controller feel.
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor FPS and latency to meet requirements.

## Stakeholder Communication
- **Weekly Updates**: Email progress reports to the client.
- **Playtest Feedback**: Share results and planned refinements.
- **Investor Materials**: Prepare a demo video highlighting key features and funding potential.

## Conclusion
This Implementation Plan provides a structured approach to developing *PulseFire*, ensuring the team delivers a high-quality FPS prototype within budget and timeline constraints, positioning it for potential funding and expansion.
