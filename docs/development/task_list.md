## Total Estimated Time
- **Phase 1**: 10.5 hours
- **Phase 2**: 38 hours
- **Phase 3**: 38 hours
- **Phase 4**: 32 hours
- **Phase 5**: 36 hours
- **Phase 6**: 24 hours
- **Total**: 178.5 hours (~2-3 weeks with focused effort)

## Budget Considerations
- **Tools**: $0 (Unreal Engine is free)
- **Assets**: Up to $200
- **Hardware**: Up to $300 for testing
- **Miscellaneous**: $500 buffer
- **Total**: $1,000

## Dependencies and Critical Path
- **Critical Path**: 1.1 → 1.2 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 4.4 → 5.1 → 6.1
- Multiplayer (Phase 3) requires core mechanics (Phase 2); UI (Phase 4) needs multiplayer setup.

## Risk Management
- **Delays in Multiplayer**: Extra testing time and documentation use.
- **Performance Issues**: Early optimization and hardware testing.
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to outlined tasks, defer extras.

## Conclusion
This task list ensures *PulseFire* development stays on track, delivering a solid FPS prototype within budget and time constraints, ready for client review and potential funding.
