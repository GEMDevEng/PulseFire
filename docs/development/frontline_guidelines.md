# Frontline Guidelines for *PulseFire* Development

## Key Points
- These guidelines outline best practices for developing *PulseFire*, an FPS prototype.
- They cover coding, art, sound, user experience, project management, testing, networking, and security.
- The focus is on ensuring quality within a tight $1,000 budget.
- Guidelines aim to align the team for a polished, fundable prototype.

## Purpose
The *Frontline Guidelines* provide a framework for the development team to create *PulseFire*, a first-person shooter (FPS) prototype inspired by *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas* and *Call of Duty*. These guidelines ensure the game meets quality standards, remains within budget, and appeals to gamers and potential investors.

## Scope
The guidelines apply to all aspects of *PulseFire*'s development, including coding, art, sound, user experience, project management, testing, networking, and security. They are tailored to the prototype's goal of delivering a small multiplayer map with responsive controller mechanics.

## Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Use clear, descriptive variable names for readability.
- Follow Unreal Engine's coding conventions for C++ and Blueprints.
- Commit code to Git regularly with detailed commit messages.
- Write unit tests for critical systems like movement and shooting.
- Optimize code for performance to maintain 60 FPS on mid-range PCs.

### Art and Animation
- Adopt a tactical, realistic art style inspired by source games.
- Optimize assets (e.g., low-poly models, compressed textures) for performance.
- Ensure smooth animations for actions like shooting and reloading.
- Use placeholder assets initially, replacing with final versions before delivery.
- Maintain a consistent color palette for visual cohesion.

### Sound Design
- Use realistic sound effects for weapons and footsteps.
- Balance audio levels to avoid overpowering gameplay.
- Implement spatial audio for immersive multiplayer experiences.
- Test sounds across different hardware for compatibility.
- Select music that enhances tactical and action moments, if budget allows.

### User Experience
- Design intuitive controller mappings (e.g., right trigger for shooting).
- Ensure accessibility with options like adjustable sensitivity.
- Gather playtester feedback to refine mechanics and map design.
- Maintain low input latency (<50ms) for responsiveness.
- Provide clear HUD elements for health, ammo, and timer.

### Project Management
- Use agile methods (e.g., Scrum) for task management.
- Track progress with tools like Trello or Jira.
- Hold weekly check-ins to align on goals and resolve issues.
- Set milestones for key deliverables (e.g., multiplayer functionality).
- Document decisions in a shared repository for transparency.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct playtests with 2-4 players to evaluate gameplay.
- Test for bugs, prioritizing crashes and multiplayer desyncs.
- Verify performance on target hardware (e.g., RTX 3060 equivalent).
- Use automated tests for core mechanics where feasible.
- Incorporate playtester feedback to improve controller feel.

### Networking and Multiplayer
- Ensure stable LAN multiplayer for 2-4 players.
- Implement client-side prediction for smooth online play.
- Handle disconnections gracefully, allowing reconnections.
- Provide clear instructions for hosting/joining sessions.
- Design networking to support future scalability.

### Security
- Use server-authoritative logic for hit detection and movement.
- Validate inputs to prevent exploits (e.g., speed hacks).
- Leverage Unreal Engine's encryption for network traffic.
- Monitor for potential cheating during playtests.
