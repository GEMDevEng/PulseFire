# Job Analysis Report for Unreal Engine Developer Position

## Summary
This job analysis examines a posting for an Unreal Engine developer to create a first-person shooter (FPS) prototype with a focus on controller-based shooting mechanics. The project draws inspiration from games like Rainbow Six Vegas and Call of Duty, aiming to produce a small multiplayer map to test the game concept. The fixed budget is $1,000, targeting an intermediate-level developer, with potential for ongoing work if funding is secured post-prototype.

## Key Points
- **Role**: Unreal Engine developer for an FPS prototype.
- **Budget**: $1,000 fixed-price, which may be lower than typical market rates.
- **Skills Needed**: Proficiency in Unreal Engine, FPS game development, and controller support.
- **Deliverable**: A small multiplayer map with responsive controls.
- **Opportunity**: Potential for further work if the prototype secures funding.

## Project Overview
The client seeks a developer to build a prototype for an action game combining elements of Rainbow Six Vegas and Call of Duty. The primary focus is on creating smooth, controller-based shooting mechanics, with the prototype serving as a proof-of-concept to attract funding for further development. The job is listed as an ongoing project, suggesting possible future collaboration if the prototype succeeds.

## Required Skills and Experience
The role demands a solid background in Unreal Engine, particularly in developing FPS games with controller support. Candidates should demonstrate the ability to create responsive controls akin to those in Halo or Call of Duty, either through previous work or a clear explanation of their approach. Familiarity with multiplayer game development is also implied, given the requirement for a testable multiplayer map.

## Budget and Feasibility
The $1,000 budget is notably lower than typical costs for FPS prototype development, which can range from $1,750 to $6,500 based on average hourly rates of $35â€“$65 for Unreal Engine developers. Completing the prototype within this budget may require leveraging existing assets, templates, or the client's prior Unreal Engine 5.4 build to reduce development time.

## Recommendations for Applicants
Applicants should emphasize their Unreal Engine expertise and FPS experience, providing links to relevant projects if available. Highlighting familiarity with controller mechanics and multiplayer systems will strengthen a bid. Given the budget constraints, proposing a streamlined scope or use of the client's existing build could demonstrate practicality and alignment with the client's needs.
