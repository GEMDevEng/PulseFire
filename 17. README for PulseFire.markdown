# PulseFire

## Overview
*PulseFire* is a first-person shooter (FPS) prototype developed using Unreal Engine 5.4, designed to deliver a thrilling multiplayer experience with responsive controller-based gameplay. Inspired by *Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Vegas* and *Call of Duty*, it blends tactical depth with fast-paced action. This prototype supports 2-4 players over a local area network (LAN) on a compact multiplayer map, serving as a proof-of-concept to showcase core mechanics and attract funding for full development.

The project targets FPS enthusiasts aged 18-34 who prefer controller input, offering intuitive controls, a minimalistic user interface, and a competitive match structure. Built within a $1,000 budget, *PulseFire* leverages Unreal Engine’s robust features and existing assets to maximize quality and efficiency.

## Features
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Supports 2-4 players in LAN-based matches, with a listen server hosting the game session.
- **Controller-Optimized Mechanics**: Responsive movement (walk, jump, crouch), shooting, and reloading, tailored for Xbox-style controllers.
- **User Interface**: Includes a main menu, multiplayer menu, in-game HUD (health, ammo, timer), pause menu, and results screen.
- **Match Structure**: Timed matches (5 minutes) with kill-based scoring, ending with a results screen displaying final scores.
- **Performance**: Targets 60 FPS on mid-range hardware (e.g., RTX 3060 equivalent) with input latency below 50ms.
