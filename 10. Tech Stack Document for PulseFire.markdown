- **Blueprints**
  - **Role**: Visual scripting system for rapid prototyping, implementing gameplay logic, menus, and UI elements.
  - **Rationale**: Enables quick iteration, ideal for a prototype with a tight timeline. Reduces coding complexity for non-programmers, as seen in industry examples like [Udemy’s FPS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-multiplayer-team-based-fps-in-blueprints/).

### Networking
- **Unreal Engine’s Built-in Networking**
  - **Role**: Supports a Server-Client architecture with a listen server model, enabling 2-4 player LAN multiplayer.
  - **Rationale**: Eliminates the need for external networking solutions, keeping costs low. Provides replication for game state (e.g., player positions, health) and RPCs for actions like shooting, as detailed in the Backend Structure document.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Listen server created via “Create Session” blueprint node.
    - Client connections handled by direct IP input.
    - Local prediction ensures responsive controller input (<50ms latency).

### Version Control
- **Git**
  - **Role**: Manages source code, Blueprints, and assets, enabling collaboration and version tracking.
  - **Rationale**: Standard in game development for small teams, as mentioned in the Frontline Guidelines. A private repository ensures secure access, supporting the project’s documentation needs.

### Project Management
- **Trello or Jira**
  - **Role**: Tracks tasks, milestones, and progress, facilitating agile development.
  - **Rationale**: Recommended in the Frontline Guidelines for Scrum-based workflows. Trello’s simplicity suits a small team, while Jira offers scalability if needed, ensuring alignment with weekly check-ins.

### Asset Creation
- **Existing Assets**
  - **Role**: Utilizes the client’s previous Unreal Engine 5.4 build or free assets from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store).
